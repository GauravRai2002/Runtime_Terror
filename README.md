# Runtime_Terror
Our Motivation :- 

Recently there was an incident of knife attack at a marketplace where CCTVs were present to record the footage of every movement. But when the investigating officer tried to reach for the required footage (knife stabbing), he had to go through the whole footage of the day and also the resolution of the footage was low due to which the officer was not able to get any useful information.


What our Idea Does :- 

-> We will first detect the person whith the object of interest and will form a bounding box around it 

-> We will thwn detect the surroundings around the marked person frame by frame

-> When any other person or animal comes at a concerning distance (will br given to dataset) it will permanently save the recording and also will take a screenshot along with the   timestamp 

-> Then we will use super resolution technique to enhance the resolution of the concerned footage.
